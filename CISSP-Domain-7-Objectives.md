[Domain 7](#domain7-top) **Security Operations**

[7.1](#7.1) Understand and comply with investigations (OSG-9 Chpt 19)
- 7.1.1 Evidence collection and handling
    - Evidence collection is complex, should be done by professionals, and can be thrown out of court if incorrectly handled
    - Itâ€™s important to preserve original evidence
    - International Organization on Computer Evidence (IOCE) six principles for media, network and software analysis:
        - all general forensic and procedural principles must be applied to digital evidence collection 
        - seizing digital evidence shouldn't change the evidence
        - accessing original digital evidence should only be done by trained professionals
        - all activity relating to seizure, access, storage, or transfer of digital evidence must be fully documented, preserved, and available for review
        - a person in possession of digital evidence is responsible for all actions taken with respect to that evidence
        - any agency that is responsible for seizing, accessing, storing, or transferring digital evidence is responsible for compliance with these principles
    - Scientific Working Group on Digital Evidence (SWGDE) developed principles for standardized recovery of computer-based evidence:
        - legal system consistency
        - use of a common language
        - durability
        - ability to cross international and state boundaries
        - instill confidence in evidence integrity
        - forensic evidence applicability at the individual, agency, and country levels
    - **ISO/IEC 27037: Guidelines for Identification, Collection, Acquisition, and Preservation of Digital Evidence**: the international standard on digital evidence handling, with four phases:
        - identification
        - collection 
        - acquisition
